# Pico-W-Robot
## Micropython code to control a basic robot using a web interface
Initially using L298N motor driver on a Dagu multi-chassis (4WD version)

Uses 2 pairs of DC motors from the Dagu kit, PWM speed control, power from 3S LiPo battery and driver board's voltage converter

Then switched to a DRV8833 motor driver.

Platform on top of Dagu metal chassis designed in OpenSCAD, printed in PLA on a Prusa i3 Mk3S

Pictures "front" and "back" show the first prototype print.
